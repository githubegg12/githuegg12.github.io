Tech companies are not messuring this carbon footprint
Larger models emit 14 times more carbon doing the same task than smaller models


CodeCarbon, tool that runs in parallel to AI training code that estimate the amount of energy it consumes and the amount of carbons it emits to help us to choice the more sustainable model or deploying AI models on renewable energy which can drastically reduce their emission
